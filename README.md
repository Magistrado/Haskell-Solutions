# Haskell Solutions

In this repo, I practice some Haskell's features like monads, monad transformers, concurrency programming and parallel programming. 

Within each folder:
- Aiport blackboard: A basic terminal application. I order to practice my Haskell skills. I took a university project and I made it again.
- SPOJ solutions: I submit my solutions to selected SPOJ's problems. In the source code, there is the link to those problems I solved.
- Parallel-concurrent: I took two university project to test Haskell's threads which is `juegodedados` and semiimplicit parallelism built-in Haskell which is `solucionesParalelas`.
